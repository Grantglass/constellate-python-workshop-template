# TAP Institute 2022 Machine Learning Workshop

This repository contains materials for the 2022 Text Analysis Pedagogy (TAP) Institute in Machine Learning. The TAP Institute is using the [Constellate Platform](https://constellate.org) for teaching and learning. Constellate uses Binder to render Jupyter Notebooks in the user's browser.


# Testing your lesson in Constellate

The only required file for your lesson is at least one Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. This is supplied by the default template. A full workshop may include 3 or more notebook files (e.g. "python-basics-1.ipynb", "python-basics-2.ipynb", "python-basics-3.ipyb"). More files may be required but each lesson should use the same general template.

You can generate a Constellate link for testing your lesson at: [https://constellate.org/notebook/own/](https://constellate.org/notebook/own/)

You'll need to fill in some data about your GitHub repository:

* GitHub repository URL
* Git branch, tag, or commit (optional)
* Path to a particular notebook file (optional)

# Teaching with Constellate

Share the link you generated above with your students. If the class is large, it may take a few minutes for everyone's environment to load.
